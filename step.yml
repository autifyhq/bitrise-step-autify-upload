  Autify Upload
summary: |
  Upload a build file to Autify for Mobile.
description: |
  [Autify for Mobile](https://autify.com/mobile) is a test automation platform for your native app.
  This step allows you to upload your app built in the previous steps to Autify.

  You need to build your app first by `Android Build`, `Xcode build for simulator`, etc.
  and refer the target build path (*.apk or *.app) at `Build path to test` input.

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
# You can find more information about project type tags in the Step Development Guideline:

project_type_tags:
  - ios
